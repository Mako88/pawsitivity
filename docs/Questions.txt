How much base time for each breed?

Is the signature up charge per breed, per group, or across the board? And is it different for a bath vs a spa?

Do we still need MaxDogs or is it all time based?

How long should we store scheduled pets before deleting them?

Should partial days be supported, or will a groomer either be there all day or be off all day?
